name: brainstorm
description: Interactive idea refinement using Socratic questioning methodology. This skill should be used when users want to explore an idea, find gaps in concepts, enhance proposals, or structure thoughts before implementation planning. Triggers on "brainstorm", "explore this idea", "find holes in", "help me think through", "what am I missing", or when presenting rough concepts that need refinement. Output integrates with create-plan skill.

# Brainstorm

## Overview

This skill provides structured brainstorming through Socratic questioning, multi-perspective analysis (Six Thinking Hats, SCAMPER), and proactive research. It helps users refine raw ideas into well-structured concepts ready for implementation planning.

## Initial Response

When this skill is invoked, respond:

> "I'm ready to help you explore and refine your idea. Share what you're thinking about, and I'll ask questions to help clarify, challenge assumptions, and identify opportunities. We'll continue the exploration until you're satisfied, then I'll research relevant patterns and structure the concept."

## Workflow (6 Phases)

### Phase 1: Idea Capture

Parse the user's initial idea/concept and identify:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Core Concept** | The fundamental idea being proposed |
| **Stated Goals** | What the user explicitly wants to achieve |
| **Implied Constraints** | Limitations mentioned or implied |
| **Project Context** | Whether this relates to an existing codebase |

**Project Context Detection** - Flag for codebase research when:
- User mentions specific files, modules, or features
- User references "the current system" or "our codebase"
- User mentions extending/modifying existing functionality
- Context includes technical terms specific to a project domain

After parsing, summarize understanding and begin Phase 2.

### Phase 2: Socratic Clarification

Engage in iterative questioning until the user signals readiness to proceed.

**Question Categories** (reference: `references/questioning-frameworks.md`):

1. **Scope Questions**
   - "What boundaries should this have?"
   - "What's explicitly out of scope?"
   - "How does this fit with existing systems?"

2. **Assumption Questions**
   - "What are we taking for granted here?"
   - "What would happen if [assumption] wasn't true?"
   - "What implicit dependencies exist?"

3. **Alternative Questions**
   - "What other approaches could achieve this?"
   - "What's the opposite of this approach?"
   - "What would [different stakeholder] suggest?"

4. **Consequence Questions**
   - "What happens if this succeeds?"
   - "What happens if this fails?"
   - "What are the second-order effects?"

5. **Evidence Questions**
   - "What supports this approach?"
   - "How could we test this assumption?"
   - "What evidence would change your mind?"

**Continuation Protocol**:
- Ask 2-4 questions per round
- After each round, offer: "I have more questions if you'd like to continue exploring, or we can move to research and analysis. Your call."
- Continue until user explicitly signals readiness (e.g., "let's move on", "I'm ready", "that's enough questions")
- Do NOT rush this phase - thorough questioning produces better outcomes

### Phase 3: Context Gathering

Spawn parallel agents to gather context. Execute all relevant research in a single message with multiple Task tool calls.

**Always spawn - Web Research**:
```
Task(subagent_type="web-search-researcher",
     prompt="Research best practices, common patterns, and pitfalls for [idea topic].
             Find:
             1. Similar implementations and how they succeeded/failed
             2. Industry best practices and anti-patterns to avoid
             3. Common technical approaches and their trade-offs
             4. Lessons learned from comparable projects
             Focus on actionable insights, not just general information.")
```

**Spawn when project context detected - Codebase Research**:
```
Task(subagent_type="codebase-locator",
     prompt="Find all files related to [relevant feature area]. Include:
             - Core implementation files
             - Configuration and setup files
             - Test files
             - Documentation")

Task(subagent_type="codebase-analyzer",
     prompt="Analyze how [related functionality] is currently implemented.
             Trace the data flow and identify integration points.
             Include file:line references.")

Task(subagent_type="codebase-pattern-finder",
     prompt="Find implementation patterns for [type of implementation] in this codebase.
             Look for:
             - Similar features and how they're structured
             - Conventions for [relevant patterns]
             - Testing approaches used")
```

Wait for all agents to complete using AgentOutputTool before proceeding.

### Phase 4: Multi-Perspective Analysis

Apply structured frameworks to analyze the refined idea systematically.

**Six Thinking Hats Analysis**:

| Hat | Focus | Questions to Apply |
|-----|-------|-------------------|
| **White** | Facts | What facts do we have? What data is missing? What do we need to know? |
| **Red** | Intuition | What's the gut reaction? What feels risky? What's exciting about this? |
| **Black** | Risks | What could go wrong? What obstacles exist? What are the failure modes? |
| **Yellow** | Benefits | What benefits does this bring? What opportunities exist? What's the best case? |
| **Green** | Creativity | What creative alternatives exist? What's an unconventional approach? What if we combined this with something else? |
| **Blue** | Process | Is this the right problem to solve? Are we approaching this correctly? What's the next step? |

**SCAMPER Enhancement Scan**:

| Letter | Question | Application |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **S**ubstitute | What could be replaced? | Alternative technologies, patterns, approaches |
| **C**ombine | What could be merged? | Related features, existing capabilities |
| **A**dapt | What could be adjusted from elsewhere? | Patterns from other domains |
| **M**odify | What could be amplified or reduced? | Scope, complexity, features |
| **P**ut to other use | What alternative applications exist? | Reusability, generalization |
| **E**liminate | What could be removed? | Unnecessary complexity, redundant features |
| **R**everse | What could be reorganized? | Order of operations, dependencies |

**Premortem Analysis**:

Apply this framework to identify preventable failure modes:

1. "Imagine this idea has completely failed 6 months from now."
2. "What went wrong?"
3. "What warning signs did we ignore?"
4. "What did we underestimate?"
5. "What external factors contributed?"
6. "Now: How do we prevent each of these?"

Document findings for each framework.

### Phase 5: Synthesis

Consolidate all findings into actionable insights:

**Validated Strengths**
- List strengths confirmed by analysis
- Include supporting evidence from research

**Identified Gaps**
- List gaps discovered through questioning and analysis
- Include suggested approaches for each gap

**Enhancement Opportunities**
- List improvements identified through SCAMPER
- Prioritize by impact and feasibility

**Risk Assessment**
- List risks from Black Hat and Premortem analysis
- Include mitigation strategies for each

**Key Decisions Required**
- List open questions that need user decision
- Provide options with trade-offs

### Phase 6: Structure & Output

Structure the concept into logical components and write results.

**Determine Output Location**:
- Default: `docs/brainstorms/YYYY-MM-DD-{topic-slug}.md`
- Create directory if it doesn't exist
- Use descriptive slug from core concept

**Write Structured Output** using this format:

```markdown

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing output, verify:

- [ ] All Socratic clarifications were documented
- [ ] Web research was conducted and synthesized
- [ ] Codebase research was conducted (if project context detected)

## Best Practices

### Effective Questioning
- Ask open-ended questions, not yes/no
- Use "what" and "how" more than "why" (less confrontational)
- Build on previous answers
- Acknowledge good insights before probing deeper

### Avoiding Common Pitfalls
- Don't rush the Socratic phase - depth matters
- Don't criticize ideas during clarification - that's for analysis
- Don't skip frameworks - each provides unique perspective
- Don't present analysis without actionable next steps

### Integration with Create-Plan
The output format is designed to feed directly into create-plan:
- "Structured Concept" maps to implementation phases
- "Gaps" become tasks to address
- "Risks" become items in "Risks and Mitigations"
- "Research Findings" inform design decisions
