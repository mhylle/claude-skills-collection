### 2. Assumption Probing

**Purpose**: Surface hidden beliefs and dependencies

| Question | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| "What are we assuming here?" | Any significant claim |
| "What would happen if [assumption] wasn't true?" | Critical assumptions |
| "Is this always the case, or are there exceptions?" | Generalizations |
| "How did you arrive at that conclusion?" | Unjustified claims |

### 3. Evidence Questions

**Purpose**: Ground claims in verifiable information

| Question | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| "What supports this approach?" | Any recommendation |
| "What evidence contradicts this?" | One-sided arguments |
| "How could we test this assumption?" | Unverified beliefs |

### 4. Perspective Questions

**Purpose**: Explore multiple viewpoints and stakeholders

| Question | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|

| "What's the worst-case scenario?" | Risk mitigation |

### 6. Meta Questions

**Purpose**: Question the question itself and overall direction

| Question | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| "Why is this question important?" | Priority assessment |

## Six Thinking Hats Framework

### Hat Overview

|-----|-------|-------|---------|
| White | Neutral | Facts | "What information do we have?" |
| Red | Emotional | Feelings | "What does intuition say?" |

- What opportunities exist?
- What's the best-case outcome?
- What advantages does this have?
- Who benefits from this?
- What value does this create?
- What problems does this solve?
```

#### Green Hat (Creativity & Alternatives)

```

- What would a completely new solution look like?
- What constraints could we remove?
- What analogies from other fields apply?
```

#### Blue Hat (Process & Meta)

```
- Is this the right problem to solve?
- Are we approaching this correctly?
- What's the next step?
- Have we considered all perspectives?
- What's our decision criteria?
- When do we need to decide?
- Who needs to be involved?
```

## SCAMPER Framework

### Overview

SCAMPER is an acronym for seven techniques to systematically explore modifications:

| Letter | Technique | Core Question |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| S | Substitute | What can be replaced? |
| C | Combine | What can be merged? |
| A | Adapt | What can be adjusted? |
| M | Modify | What can be changed? |
| P | Put to other use | What else can it do? |
| E | Eliminate | What can be removed? |
| R | Reverse | What can be reorganized? |

### Detailed Prompts

#### Substitute
```
- What component could we replace?
- What technology could substitute?
- What process could we swap out?
- What material/resource could we use instead?
- Who else could do this?
- What location/time could change?
```

#### Combine
```
- What features could we merge?
- What systems could integrate?
- What ideas could we blend?
- What resources could we pool?
- What steps could combine?
- What purposes could unite?
```

#### Adapt
```
- What could we adjust from another domain?
- How could we customize for different users?
- What patterns from elsewhere apply?
- How has this problem been solved before?
- What can we borrow and modify?
- How could we make this fit our context?
```

#### Modify
```
- What could we make larger/smaller?
- What could we make faster/slower?
- What could we make simpler/more complex?
- What could we strengthen/weaken?
- What attribute could we change?
- What frequency/intensity could shift?
```

#### Put to Other Use
```
- What else could this be used for?
- Who else could use this?
- What other problems could this solve?
- What happens if we change the context?
- What's an unexpected application?
- How could this be repurposed?
```

```

#### Reverse/Rearrange
```
- What if we reversed the order?
- What if we swapped roles?
- What if we did the opposite?
- What could we rearrange?
- What if we worked backwards?
- What if we changed the sequence?
```

## Premortem Analysis Framework

### Purpose

Imagine the project has failed, then work backwards to identify preventable causes.

### Standard Protocol

**Step 1: Set the Scene**
```
"It's [6 months/1 year] from now. This idea has completely failed.
The implementation was a disaster. Let's figure out what went wrong."
```

**Step 2: Individual Brainstorm**
Each perspective contributes failure modes:
```
- Technical: "What technical issues caused failure?"
- User: "What user problems caused failure?"
- Business: "What business factors caused failure?"
- External: "What external forces caused failure?"
```

**Step 3: Categorize Failures**

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Technical | Performance issues, security vulnerabilities, integration failures |
| Resource | Budget overrun, skill gaps, time constraints |
| Scope | Feature creep, unclear requirements, wrong priorities |
| Stakeholder | Miscommunication, resistance to change, misaligned expectations |
| External | Market changes, competitor actions, regulatory changes |

**Step 4: Prevention Strategies**
For each failure mode identified:
```
- Failure: [Description]
- Warning signs: [What would indicate this is happening]
- Prevention: [How to avoid this]
- Contingency: [If it happens anyway, what's the backup]
```

### Premortem Question Templates

```
1. "What went wrong?"
   - Technical problems
   - People problems
   - Process problems
   - External problems

2. "What warning signs did we ignore?"
   - Early indicators
   - Feedback we dismissed
   - Concerns we minimized

3. "What did we underestimate?"
   - Complexity
   - Time required
   - Resources needed
   - Dependencies

4. "What external factors contributed?"
   - Market changes
   - Competitor actions
   - Technology shifts
   - Regulatory changes

5. "What assumptions proved wrong?"
   - User behavior assumptions
   - Technical assumptions
   - Business assumptions
   - Timeline assumptions
```

## Usage Guidelines

### Selecting Frameworks

| Situation | Primary Framework | Supporting Frameworks |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Initial exploration | Socratic Questions | - |
| Evaluating feasibility | Six Thinking Hats | SCAMPER (Green Hat) |
| Improving existing idea | SCAMPER | Six Thinking Hats |
| Risk assessment | Premortem | Six Thinking Hats (Black) |
| Comprehensive analysis | All four | Use in sequence |

### Question Pacing

- **Early rounds**: Focus on clarification and assumptions
- **Middle rounds**: Explore alternatives and consequences
- **Later rounds**: Address risks and meta-questions

### Avoiding Pitfalls

1. **Don't overwhelm**: 2-4 questions per round max
2. **Don't criticize during clarification**: Save judgment for analysis phase
3. **Don't skip frameworks**: Each provides unique perspective
4. **Don't rush**: Depth matters more than speed
5. **Don't lead**: Ask open questions, don't guide to predetermined answers
